# Preface {-}

This book is a compilation of the work I performed in ESS580A7 during the spring
of 2022. Much of the code making up the demos and their associated assignments 
have been written by Matthew Ross and Nathan Mueller, the instructors of the 
course. 

Help for getting started with this bookdown came from [Sean Kross's Github.](https://github.com/seankross/bookdown-start)

Each course assignment forms a chapter in this bookdown.
