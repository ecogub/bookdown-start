# R markdown Examples

The first activity in the class was to create this basic R markdown document. The
document uses several handy features from markdown, including italics, bolding, and 
hyperlinking. In the 'Methods' section, Matt demos how to use some of these skills.

## Methods

The Poudre River at Lincoln Bridge is:

  - Downstream of only a little bit of urban stormwater

  - Near Odell Brewing CO
  
  - Near an open space area and the Poudre River Trail
  
  - **Downstream of many agricultural diversions**


### SiteDescription

### Data Acquisition and Plotting tests

### Data Download


```{r downloader}

q <- readNWISdv(siteNumbers = '06752260',
                parameterCd = '00060',
                startDate = '2017-01-01',
                endDate = '2022-01-01') %>%
  rename(q = 'X_00060_00003')


```



### Static Data Plotter


```{r, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 5}

ggplot(q, aes(x = Date, y = q)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  ylab('Q (cfs)') + 
  ggtitle('Discharge in the Poudre River, Fort Collins')

```


### Interactive Data Plotter


```{r}

q_xts <- xts(q$q, order.by = q$Date)


dygraph(q_xts) %>%
  dyAxis("y", label = "Discharge (cfs)") 
```



## Assignment 


This assignment will be primarily about demonstrating some expertice in using
RMarkdown, since we will be using Rmds as the primary form of homework and 
assignments. With that in mind, your assignment for this homework is to:


1) Fork the example repository into your personal GitHub

2) Create an RStudio project from your Personal clone of the Repo. 

3) Create a table of contents that is floating, but displays three levels of
headers instead of two (by editing the content at the beginning of the document)

4) Make a version of the `dygraph` with points and lines by using rstudio's
dygraph [guide](https://rstudio.github.io/dygraphs/)

5) Write a paragraph on the Poudre river with at least three hyperlinks,
**two bolded sections**, and one *italicized phrase*. The content of this paragraph
is not vital, but try to at least make it true and interesting, and, of course,
don't plagiarize. 

6) Knit that document, and then git commit and push to your personal GitHub.

7) Use the GitHub -> Settings -> Pages tab to create a website of your report.

8) Bonus, make the timestamp in the header dynamic. As in it only adds
todays date, not just a static date you enter. 

9) Bonus, create an "index_talk.Rmd" version of your document using the
`revealjs` package. Add link to your original report-style document. 




#### DyGraph example. 

```{r}

dygraph(q_xts) %>%
  dyAxis("y", label = "Discharge (cfs)") %>%
  dyOptions(drawPoints = TRUE, pointSize = 2)

```


#### Poudre Paragraph

**The [Poudre River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_la_Poudre_River) has a USGS gauge located in Fort Collins, Colorado.** The gauge's National Water Information System number is [0672260](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/wys_rpt/?site_no=06752260&agency_cd=USGS) and its' name is 'Cache la Poudre River at Fort Collins, CO'.  As an interesting aside, the USGS has precise language for when a gauge (which they spell *gage*) is 'at', 'near', or 'outside' a given municipality. The Poudre river has a [watershed area of 1127 square miles](https://streamstatsags.cr.usgs.gov/gagePages/html/06752260.html) and has a mean annual flow of 171 cfs. **This makes the Poudre a relatively small stream compared to many in the USGS network.**
